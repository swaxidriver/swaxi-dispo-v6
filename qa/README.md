## üéØ Quick Start

### For Manual Testing

1. Set up test environment (local or staging)
2. Create test user accounts for all roles (ADMIN, CHIEF, DISPONENT, ANALYST)
3. Follow the manual checklist systematically
4. Document any issues found using the provided templates

### For Bug Bash Sessions

1. Schedule session 2 weeks in advance
2. Follow the bug-bash-guide for preparation
3. Execute 2-hour structured testing session
4. Triage and prioritize findings immediately after

## üîó Integration with Development

### Test Environment URLs

- **Local Development:** `http://localhost:5173/swaxi-dispo-v6/`
- **Live Demo:** `https://swaxidriver.github.io/swaxi-dispo-v6/`
- **Test Page:** `http://localhost:5173/swaxi-dispo-v6/test`

### Test User Roles

The system supports four distinct user roles with different permissions:

| Role          | Permissions                       | Test Focus                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **ADMIN**     | Full system access                | All functionality, security boundaries |
| **CHIEF**     | Shift management, no audit access | Management workflows, assignment       |
| **DISPONENT** | Apply for shifts, limited view    | User workflows, applications           |
| **ANALYST**   | Read-only analytics               | Reporting, data display                |

### Key Test Scenarios

#### Critical Path Testing

1. **Login** ‚Üí Role selection and authentication
2. **Shift Designer** ‚Üí Template creation and management
3. **Generate** ‚Üí Bulk shift creation from templates
4. **Assign** ‚Üí Manual assignment with conflict detection
5. **Export** ‚Üí Data export and analytics

#### Edge Case Focus Areas

- **Cross-midnight shifts** (22:00-06:00 scenarios)
- **RBAC boundaries** (unauthorized access attempts)
- **Conflict detection** (overlapping shifts, location mismatches)
- **Mobile responsiveness** (all screen sizes)
- **Accessibility** (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
