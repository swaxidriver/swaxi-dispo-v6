# Rule Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview
The rule engine has been successfully implemented to prevent double-booking of Disponent assignments with a complete override mechanism and audit trail.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Rule Engine
- **`backend/rule-engine.js`** - Main rule engine with business rule definitions and enforcement logic
- **`backend/rule-engine.test.js`** - Comprehensive unit tests for the rule engine

### Frontend Integration  
- **`src/services/ruleEngineService.js`** - Service layer providing UI-friendly API
- **`src/services/ruleEngineService.test.js`** - Service layer tests
- **`src/hooks/useRuleEngine.js`** - React hooks for easy component integration

### Integration Tests
- **`src/tests/rule-engine-integration.test.js`** - Integration tests with existing conflict system
- **`src/tests/rule-engine-demo.test.js`** - End-to-end demonstration of complete flow

## Acceptance Criteria Implementation

### ✅ Prevent Double-booking
- **PREVENT_DOUBLE_BOOKING** rule detects and blocks overlapping shift assignments for the same person
- Integrates with existing conflict detection system (`TIME_OVERLAP`, `ASSIGNMENT_COLLISION`)
- Marking as `BLOCKING` severity prevents assignment without override

### ✅ Allow Override with Reason/Approver
- Override mechanism requires:
  - Business justification reason
  - Approver name and role
  - Current user context for audit trail
- Overrides are stored and tracked per shift/rule combination
- Once override is created, assignment becomes allowed

### ✅ Persist Rule Outcomes
- All rule evaluations logged via `AuditService.logAction()`
- Override creation, application, and removal tracked
- Audit entries include:
  - Rule evaluation results
  - Override creation with full context
  - Override application during enforcement
  - Override removal with justification

## Rule Definitions

### PREVENT_DOUBLE_BOOKING
- **Severity**: BLOCKING  
- **Description**: Prevents assigning the same person to overlapping shifts
- **Conflict Codes**: `TIME_OVERLAP`, `ASSIGNMENT_COLLISION`
- **Allow Override**: Yes

### LOCATION_CONSISTENCY
- **Severity**: WARNING
- **Description**: Warns when same person assigned to different locations simultaneously  
- **Conflict Codes**: `LOCATION_MISMATCH`
- **Allow Override**: Yes

### REST_PERIOD
- **Severity**: WARNING
- **Description**: Ensures adequate rest between consecutive shifts
- **Conflict Codes**: `SHORT_TURNAROUND`
- **Allow Override**: Yes

## API Usage Examples

### Basic Validation
```javascript
import RuleEngineService from '../services/ruleEngineService.js';

const validation = await RuleEngineService.validateAssignment(
  targetShift, 
  existingShifts, 
  applications
);

if (!validation.isValid) {
  // Handle rule violations
  console.log('Violations:', validation.violations);
}
```

### Creating Override
```javascript
const overrideResult = await RuleEngineService.createOverride(
  shift,
  'PREVENT_DOUBLE_BOOKING',
  {
    reason: 'Emergency coverage required due to staff illness',
    approver: 'Operations Manager',
    approverRole: 'MANAGER',
    currentUser: { name: 'John Admin', role: 'CHIEF' }
  }
);
```

### Using React Hook
```javascript
import { useRuleEngine } from '../hooks/useRuleEngine.js';

function ShiftAssignmentComponent() {
  const { validateAssignment, createOverride, isValidating } = useRuleEngine();
  
  const handleAssignment = async () => {
    const result = await validateAssignment(shift, existingShifts);
    if (!result.isValid && result.requiresOverride) {
      // Show override dialog
    }
  };
}
```

## Integration Points

1. **Existing Conflict Detection**: Builds on `computeShiftConflicts()` from `src/features/shifts/shifts.js`
2. **Audit Service**: Uses `AuditService` from `src/services/auditService.js`
3. **RBAC System**: Integrates with existing role-based access control
4. **UI Components**: Ready for integration with shift assignment modals and forms

## Test Coverage

- **Backend Engine**: 18 unit tests covering all rule scenarios
- **Service Layer**: 13 integration tests for frontend API
- **End-to-End**: 7 demonstration tests showing complete flows
- **Edge Cases**: Override management, error handling, audit trail validation

## Audit Trail Sample

```json
{
  "action": "rule_evaluation",
  "actor": "Chief Manager", 
  "role": "CHIEF",
  "details": {
    "shiftId": "shift-123",
    "canAssign": false,
    "violationCount": 1,
    "blockingCount": 1,
    "conflicts": ["TIME_OVERLAP", "ASSIGNMENT_COLLISION"]
  }
}

{
  "action": "rule_override_created",
  "actor": "Chief Manager",
  "role": "CHIEF", 
  "details": {
    "ruleId": "PREVENT_DOUBLE_BOOKING",
    "shiftId": "shift-123",
    "reason": "Emergency coverage required",
    "approver": "Operations Manager"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Minimal Changes**: Built on existing conflict detection system rather than replacing it
- **Backward Compatibility**: Does not break existing functionality
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new rules by extending the `RULES` configuration
- **Performance**: Leverages existing shift overlap calculations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive error logging

The rule engine successfully implements all acceptance criteria while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase and providing a solid foundation for future rule extensions.
